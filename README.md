This project is a currency converter application built using Python's Tkinter library for the graphical interface and the forex_python library for fetching currency conversion rates. It allows users to select source and target currencies from a list of common options, enter the amount to convert, and then displays the converted amount in real-time. The application handles exceptions for invalid inputs and errors during the conversion process.
